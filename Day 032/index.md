  ## Math behind reinforcement learning
- Introduction to stochastic process
  - Defination
  - Types of stochastic process
    - Discrete time vs contd time
    - markov process
    - stationary process
- Markov chain
  - Key concepts
    - Defination
    - Transistion matrix
  - State space
  - Absorbing states
Essential for reinforcement learning, combining markov chains with decision making 

- Key concepts: 
  - Components of MDP: states, actions, transition probability
  - Reward function - represents the immediate reward received after taking action a in state s 
  - Discount factor - a number between 0 and 1 that determines the importance of future rewards.

- Continuous time stochastic process 

  - Relevant in some RL applications particularly in modeling systems that evolve continuously 

- Key concepts: 

 - Poisson processes - a stochastic process that models the occurrence of events randomly over time.
 - Brownian motion  - a continuous time stochastic process that describes the random movement of particles suspended in a fluid
 - Applicaytions of stochastic process in reinf
   - Key concepts
     - Policy Evaluation
     - Temporal difference learning
     - Monte carlo methods
- Dynamic programming
